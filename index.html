  <p>Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. That's my family Kay, that's not me. I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see. They talk when they should listen. When they come... they come at what you love.

      Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind. Vito, how do you like my little angel? Isn't she beautiful? I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over! I see you took the name of the town. What was your father's name?</p>
