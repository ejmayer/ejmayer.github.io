  <p>Friends and money - oil and water. Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship. My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. Don't you know that I would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening?</p>
  <p>When they come... they come at what you love. Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything. It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.</p>
